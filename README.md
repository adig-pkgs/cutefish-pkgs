## Unofficial Arch Repository for cutefish-git packages

### Usage

Add following lines to your /etc/pacman.conf.

```
[cutefish-git]
SigLevel = Optional
Server = https://adig-pkgs.github.io/cutefish-pkgs/$arch/
```

These packages are built by Github Actions, and from the latest -git sources, hence may provide additional features as the cutefish os are updated (The repo was created for this only, as some features were very new in dock).

* All of these belong to the `cutefish-git` group

> remove\_translation patches: I removed translations due to failing builds for me, will remove these later, or eitherways you will be fine using it
